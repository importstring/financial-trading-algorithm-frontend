Trading Plan:
-------------
Final plan:
1. ACTION: reason PARAMS: I can help you plan out the next steps in your plan. Here are my suggestions:

**Step 1: Research**

* `action`: research
* `params`: "Perplexity"
* Reasoning: Start by researching different options using Perplexity, such as stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds.

```python
self.research()
```

This will output a list of available tickers that match the specified criteria. You can then select one to proceed with further analysis.

**Step 2: Insight**

* `action`: insight
* `params`: "ChatGPT"
* Reasoning: Use ChatGPT to get insights on each ticker in the research output. This will give you information on potential risks and opportunities associated with each stock.

```python
self.insight()
```

This will provide you with a list of insights for each selected ticker, which you can use to inform your decision-making process.

**Step 3: Stock Data**

* `action`: stockdata
* `params`: "tickers"
* Reasoning: Use the insights from ChatGPT and Perplexity to select a new set of tickers. Then, get the stock data for each selected ticker using this list.

```python
self.stockdata()
```

This will output a list of stock data for each selected ticker, which you can use to make a final decision about what to do next.

**Next Steps**

* You have several options for your next step:
	+ Buy: `action`: buy, `params`: [ticker, shares, price]
	+ Sell: `action`: sell, `params`: [ticker, shares, price]
	+ Hold: `action`: hold, `params`: [ticker]

You can choose one of these options based on your research and insights from the previous steps.

Which next step would you like to take?

This code provides a simple text-based interface for selecting tickers, analyzing insights, and executing trades. Note that this is a simplified example and not meant to be used as-is in production without additional error checking, validation, and security measures.
3. ACTION: reason PARAMS: Based on the provided code, I will continue to guide you through a simple text-based interface for selecting tickers, analyzing insights, and executing trades.

### Step 1: Analyzing Insights
To analyze insights related to a specific ticker, we need to modify the `get_insights` function in the `buy`, `sell`, and `hold` functions. We will add this functionality as an additional step in our plan.

```python
def get_insights(self):
    chatgpt Insights = ["Insight 1", "Insight 2"]
    perplexity Insights = ["Perplexity Value 1", "Perplexity Value 2"]
    
    for i, insight in enumerate(insights):
        print(f"{i+1}. {insight}")
        
    return [chatgpt_insight for chatgpt Insight in chatgpt Insights if chatgpt Insight in insight]
```

### Step 2: Selecting Tickers
To select tickers, we can modify the `get_tickers` function to allow users to choose their preferred sector. We will add this functionality as an additional step in our plan.

```python
def get_tickers(self):
    sectors = input("Please select the relevant sector (e.g., tech, finance): ")
    
    tickers = []
    
    if sectors == "tech":
        tickers = self.get_technology_tickers()
    elif sectors == "finance":
        tickers = self.get_finance_tickers()
        
    return tickers
```

### Step 3: Executing Trades
To execute trades, we can modify the `buy`, `sell`, and `hold` functions to prompt users for input. We will add this functionality as an additional step in our plan.

```python
def buy(self, selected_ticker):
    while True:
        try:
            shares = int(input(f"Enter number of shares to buy: "))
            if shares <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

def sell(self, selected_ticker):
    while True:
        try:
            shares_to_sell = int(input(f"Enter number of shares to sell: "))
            if shares_to_sell <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
            elif shares_to_sell > self.has_shares(selected_ticker):
                print("You do not have enough shares to sell.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

def hold(self, selected_ticker):
    while True:
        try:
            share_amount = int(input(f"Enter amount of {selected_ticker} to hold: "))
            if share_amount <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
            elif share_amount > self.get_price(selected_ticker):
                print("You do not have enough shares to hold this amount.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

def has_shares(self, selected_ticker):
    while True:
        try:
            shares = int(input(f"Enter number of shares you currently have for {selected_ticker}: "))
            if shares <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

def get_price(self, selected_ticker):
    while True:
        try:
            price = float(input(f"Enter current price of {selected_ticker}: $"))
            if price <= 0:
                print("Please enter a positive number.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")

# Example usage
research()
```

### Step 4: Executing Trades from the Main Menu
To execute trades, we can modify the main menu to allow users to select their preferred action. We will add this functionality as an additional step in our plan.

```python
def execute_trade(self):
    print("1. Buy")
    print("2. Sell")
    print("3. Hold")
    
    while True:
        try:
            choice = int(input("Enter the number of your chosen action: "))
            if choice not in [1, 2, 3]:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
            else:
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

    if choice == 1:
        selected_ticker = input("Enter the ticker of the stock you'd like to buy: ")
        shares = int(input("Enter the number of shares you'd like to purchase: "))
        price = float(input(f"Enter the current price of {selected_ticker}: $"))
        
        trade_details = {"Ticker": selected_ticker, "Shares": shares, "Price": price}
        print(trade_details)
    elif choice == 2:
        selected_ticker = input("Enter the ticker of the stock you'd like to sell: ")
        shares_to_sell = int(input("Enter the number of shares you'd like to sell: "))
        
        share_amount = int(input(f"Enter amount of {selected_ticker} to hold (in shares): "))
        trade_details = {"Ticker": selected_ticker, "Shares": shares_to_sell, "Amount": share_amount}
        print(trade_details)
    elif choice == 3:
        while True:
            try:
                share_amount = int(input(f"Enter amount of {selected_ticker} to hold (in shares): "))
                if share_amount <= 0:
                    print("Please enter a positive number.")
                else:
                    break
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter an integer.")

# Example usage
execute_trade()
```
